# 3D_Print_Virus_Mask
Designed for 3D printer open source modular face mask for Covid 19 Wuhan Flu - NATO 40mm

This project has been abandoned due to it not being practical. I will leave the files up so you can see the bennifits and drawbacks of modeing this in Alibre Atom.   

A 3d printed face sheild holder is a far better solution for mitigating the spread of a virus like the Wuhan Flue - aka covid-19 since it is not airbore.  It keeps you from infecting others via droplet and keep you from touching your face.
